1)
clone https://github.com/alperakcan/fuse-ext2 (needs to be compiled on the system)

To fix compilation issues on opensuse:
install fuse-devel package that gives libfuse

in the config.ac file add "AM_PROG_CC_C_O"  >>>>> SEEMS NOT NEEDED ON OPENSUSE TUMBLEWEED NOW

then 
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install


it'll be installed in /usr/local/bin/fuse-ext2

---------------------------
2)
clone https://github.com/hak86/android-simg2img

then run:
make

then copy simg2img bin to /usr/local/bin/simg2img

---------------------------
3)
at least on opensuse i need to run the whole thing as root otherwise fuse-ext2 can't mount the imgs
so run "su" then the extractor script with the following template commands 
(in this case move fuse-ext2 and simg2img  in /bin/ instead of /usr/local/bin/)
extracted vendor blobs will have root as owner, then u need to take ownership with:
chown -R USERNAME:users FOLDERNAME

---
Commands:

put the zip into "vendor" subfolder then:

./execute-all.sh -d angler -i "/home/ezio/Android/android-prepare-vendor/vendor/angler-opm1.171019.011-factory-39448337.zip" --full -y -o /home/ezio/Android/android-prepare-vendor/vendor/extracted/ -b opm1.171019.011 -k --deodex-all


unmount to delete out folders
umount "/home/ezio/Android/android-prepare-vendor/vendor/extracted/angler/opm1.171019.011/factory_imgs_data/system"
umount "/home/ezio/Android/android-prepare-vendor/vendor/extracted/angler/opm1.171019.011/factory_imgs_data/vendor"
